## AI policy

If you use AI (for example ChatGPT, GPT-3, Codex etc ..) in this class, you **must** create a section in your Appendix entitled **My AI use explained**, see details below.  Students' most use GitHub for their project, and misuse of AI will be presumed if students' fail to stage-committ-push regular updates before they submit their final project.

Be aware of the limits of ChatGPT:

* If you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low-quality results. You'll need to refine your prompts so you can get good outcomes. This will take work.
* Don't trust anything it says. If it gives you several facts, assume it is wrong unless you know the answer or can check in with another source. You will be responsible for any errors or omissions the tools provide. It works best for topics you understand.
* AI is a tool, but one that you should acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph at the end of the assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get results. Failure to do so is a violation of academic honesty policies.
* Be thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don't use it if it isn't appropriate for the case or circumstance.
